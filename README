 Background:
 
 This was my Grade 12 Computer Science culminating assignment. 
 We had focused on the basics of Java and the assignment was meant to demonstrate:
  - inheritance
  -
  ...
  
 I decided to build something a little outside this scope with a TV show tracker.  I didn't realize
 how much work it would be or how "outside" the scope it turned out to be.  I ended up touching on:
  > XML
  > Maven
  > web-based architecture
  > annotations

Luckily I found a framework that made things pretty easy ... Vaadin.  It's a java web framework with 
great examples on their website.  
  
Granted I probably won't remember any of these things in a few months, it was fun digging deep and 
learning a few things!
